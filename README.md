# IaC Smells

## PortSwigger CDK code smells exercise

Below is a simple AWS CDK application written in python.

The code is meant to achieve the following:
- Create an AWS EC2 Instance for an application team that wants to host a publicly available web application on it
- Create a MySQL database for the storage of the data generated by the web application

Your challenge is to review the application, as if it were a pull-request from a junior engineer, identifying ways to help them.

You should:
- Aim to spend around fifteen minutes on the challenge
- Provide a list of problems identified, referencing back to the line numbers and resources
- Not simply rewrite the code from scratch (we are looking for constructive points similar to those you would provide in a PR)

Hint: there are around 10 issues in the CDK application
