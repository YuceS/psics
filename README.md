## PortSwigger CDK Code Review exercise

You will review a simple AWS CDK Python application.

What the code does:
 - Creates an AWS EC2 instance for a team to host a public web application.
 - Creates a PostgreSQL database for storing the web app's data.
 
Your Task
 - Act as a reviewer for a junior engineerâ€™s pull request.
 - Spend ~15-30 minutes on the review.
 - Identify issues in the code (10 issues in total).
 - Reference line numbers and provide helpful feedback.
 - Do NOT rewrite the code from scratch. The goal is constructive feedback, not a complete rewrite. 
 
Key Points
 - Look for security risks, misconfigurations, bad practices.
 - Use clear, actionable feedback like you would in a PR review.
 - Use references where appropriate (e.g., AWS docs, CDK best practices).
